It is his debut as Liberal Democrat leader and he will stand up in the chamber (an arena that disadvantages the third-party leader, anyway - no despatch box to lean against, heckling from two sides of the chamber, not just one) knowing that poor performances at PMQs contributed to Ming Campbell's being labelled a dud.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The prime minister may be feeling perkier. After a grim period before Christmas, his "don't-call-it-a-relaunch" has been going well enough and, as a keen student of American politics, he will be cheered by the reminder that the polls can get it wrong and that Dull Experience need not always lose out to Flash Novelty.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Midday&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p>Gordon Brown has just come in.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Order, order. We're off.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Dai Havard, the Labour MP, says economic inactivity can only be tackled with sustained government investment. He asks for a meeting to discuss government investment in the Welsh valleys (he's MP for Merthyr). Brown says unemployment in Havard's constituency is down and that in a time of international economic uncertainty low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation stand the country in good stead.&lt;/p>&lt;p>David Cameron is up. He starts by welcoming Nick Clegg (which Brown did not do) to his first PMQs and makes a good joke about the Lib Dems being the party that replaces its leader on a regular basis. Cameron quotes a Home Office minister saying ID cards would eventually be compulsory. Is that still the government's policy?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown replies that it is but that parliament will have the final vote. ID cards would protect people's identity, and biometrics would help. He points out that Lady Neville Jones, Cameron's security spokesman in the Lords, also approves.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cameron comes back with a quote from Alistair Darling saying he did not want his life to be reduced to a magnetic strip on a card. He quotes Brown in the Observer saying the ID card scheme would not be compulsory. Why did he make such a "misleading" statement?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown goes on the offensive. He wants to know whether Cameron supports biometric ID measures for foreign nationals.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cameron says he is against ID cards. Is Brown in favour?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown says the policy is to move on, subject to a vote in parliament. Again, does Cameron support ID cards for foreign nationals?&lt;/p>&lt;p>In what may be the soundbite of the session, Cameron says - with some justice - that Brown can't give a straight answer to a straight question.&lt;/p>&lt;p>But Brown hits back. He asks again whether Cameron supports ID cards for foreign nationals, saying the whole nation does but that Cameron has twice refused to say whether he agrees.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cameron asks about capital gains tax. He quotes a Goldman Sachs report about problems in the economy. At a time like this the markets need clear leadership. So will Brown confirm that Mervyn King will be reinstated as Bank of England governor.?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown says that appointment will be made in the normal way. He claims Cameron was principle adviser to Norman Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday and praises Labour's record by contrast.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>12.15pm&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cameron says he seems to remember an opposition politician who supported the Conservative policy at the time of Black Wednesday. He then delivers a punchy attack, concluding that Brown's relaunch of his political fortunes is bound to fail.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown identifies the soundbite. "All these lines rehearsed in front of the mirror." But Cameron himself can't answer the questions. And there were 3 million unemployed under the Conservatives, while Labour has created 3 million jobs. He promises to return to Cameron's record as "chief adviser" (Cameron was actually more of a spin doctor) to Norman Lamont.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Alun Michael, the former Labour minister and Welsh first minister, asks about Somaliland and the temperature drops considerably. Brown promises to help build democracy there.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Nick Clegg is called. He says it is going to be an expensive year for British families facing fuel bill increases. Is a letter from the chanceller to the energy regulator an appropriate response?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown welcomes him to his post and says there is an "open door" if Clegg wants to discuss issues with him. And he also refers to the fact they have talked privately, which makes Clegg's hostile question sound less dangerous.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Clegg asks again about rising energy prices. He says he wants to end "the scandal of the poorest customers paying most for energy needs".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown says he will look at the issue of metering and calls for the Lib Dems to support government calls for the energy companies to subsidise their poorest customers.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Jim Cunningham, the Labour backbencher, points out that the Tory adviser Zac Goldsmith is opposed to nuclear power. Brown says there is a need for energy security and that it is a "shock" to him that the other parties are taking advice from people who think differently. He quotes Goldsmith saying he would only support nuclear power "to keep the lights on".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist party MP, asks Brown to rule out an amnesty for Irish "terrorists". Brown says it is important "to move forward with reconciliation".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Michael Connarty says Labour's New Deal welfare reform has been in place for 10 years. He says the Leonard Cheshire report on disability poverty highlights very high levels of poverty among the disabled.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown says the Pathways to Work programme is doing a lot to help and that it would be a mistake to abolish the New Deal.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Julian Brazier, the Tory, says he is glad the Guant&amp;aacute;namo Bay detention centre is being wound down but he wants to know why Guant&amp;aacute;namo inmates were returned to the UK. Brown says that, where they have been returned to Britain, the government would deal with them if there were offences to be prosecuted.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Hugh Bayley, the Labour former health minister, asks for an assurance that patients will be given more choice about their treatment. Brown says information is particularly important and that one of the next stages of NHS reform will involve making more information available to patients.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Bob Spink, the Tory, asks whether the secretary of state responsible for the poor - he means Peter Hain, the welfare secretary - should endorse a company selling sub-prime mortages. Brown picks up the story he was referring to, and says Hain endorsed the company when he visited it in his capacity as Welsh secretary.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat, comes back on fuel prices. Does Brown know that the typical pensioner household is facing bills more than £300 higher than three years ago. Why is the government cutting back on spending on home insulation?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brown says the government has increased spending on home insulation, and he rattles off the increases in the winter fuel payments.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Paddy Tipping, Labour, asks about life chances in deprived areas. Brown says the NHS initiatives announced this week, for regular check-ups, will "have a major effect on health inequalities" because of their disproportionate effect on the poor.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Mark Lancaster asks about cuts to funding for life-long learning, the subject of a Tory debate this week. Brown insists there is "more money going to education than there ever was under the [former] Conservative government".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Louise Ellman, the Labour Liverpool MP, asks if the PM will be going to Anfield for the Paul McCartney concert and whether the PM will make sure the benefits of Liverpool's year of culture are long-lasting. Brown praises the city, saying more people go to art galleries in Liverpool than in any other city in the UK.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP, asks Brown to comment on the performance of Alistair Darling, the chancellor. Brown talks about his own record as chancellor.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Anne Begg, Labour, wants to know whether the PM supports the unemployed being pushed into "work gangs" (a dig at Tory proposals). Brown says the right approach is to give people a duty to acquire their skills.&lt;/p>&lt;p>John Randall, Tory, wants to know why the government backs the forcible removal of people from their homes as a result of the Heathrow expansion. Brown says a consultation is going on but that expansion of the airport is in the "national interest".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Patricia Hewitt asks about her 16-year-old constituent Bradley Whitefield, who was killed on Christmas Day. Brown says he was shocked by the case and he promises to step up his actions against guns, gangs and knifes. He expresses his sympathy for her constituent.&lt;/p>&lt;p>And that's it. First PMQs of the year are over. &lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Instant verdict:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nick Clegg:&lt;/strong> He will breath a sigh of relief. He wasn't brilliant but he was solid and serious and chose a topic - fuel poverty - that will reinforce his credentials as a progressive politician. Interestingly, although David Cameron has invited the Lib Dems to join an alliance with the Conservatives, it was Brown who went out of his way to treat Clegg as a figure with whom he would be willing to cooperate. &lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gordon Brown:&lt;/strong> Another  unsatisfactory performance. His position on ID cards - that they won't be compulsory at first but over time would become so, subject to a vote in parliament - is not inconsistent but it is rather nuanced and hard to explain in monosyllabic terms. Cameron skewered Brown quite effectively when he demanded to know whether he was for or against the cards and Brown replied the policy was to "move ahead".&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>David Cameron:&lt;/strong> A polished performance. He was clear and specific on ID cards, and Brown's charge that he did not support ID cards for foreign nationals did not appear to throw him (although the issue could become a politicial liability for the Conservatives).&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Historical ingenuity:&lt;/strong> The award goes to John Randall, the Tory Uxbridge MP, who managed to compare the threat posed by the Heathrow expansion with the impact of the highland clearances.&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: news/blog/2008/jan/09/primeministersquestionslive9|2010-04-17T19:41:16+01:00|8943fbea64ed7f5556eb5c5b918ff1cc23527629 --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/xpxne</field></fields><tags><tag type="blog" web-title="News blog" id="news/blog" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/news/blog" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Andrew Sparrow" id="profile/andrewsparrow" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/andrewsparrow" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewsparrow" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Gordon Brown" id="politics/gordon-brown" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/gordon-brown" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="House of Commons" id="politics/houseofcommons" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/houseofcommons" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/houseofcommons" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="PMQs" id="politics/pmqs" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/pmqs" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/pmqs" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Politics TV" id="tv-and-radio/politics-tv" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/politics-tv" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/politics-tv" section-id="tv-and-radio" section-name="Television &amp;amp; radio" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
