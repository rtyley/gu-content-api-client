&lt;p>&lt;strong>David Cameron&lt;/strong> is claiming tonight that &lt;strong>Gordon Brown's&lt;/strong> cryptic language at PMQs earlier in the day signals a retreat on compulsory ID cards. He wrote to the PM asking what exactly he meant in reply to the Tory leader's own challenge.  "That is the policy but it's a matter for parliament to decide after we've looked at the voluntary system in place,'' was his answer. Labour MPs took that to mean no more than civility towards the legislature of the kind he promised last summer.&lt;/p>&lt;p>After Cameron wrote to ask whether that curious wording meant Brown personally supported the policy, No 10 and the home office insisted there was no change. Perhaps they should retreat, but they haven't: not yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there were policy changes in the system yesterday that Cameron - and the BBC - may have missed. To buy off Labour rebels in the Commons &lt;strong>Jack Straw&lt;/strong>  promised an amendment in the Lords to abolish Britain's ancient blasphemy laws. Elsewhere&lt;strong> Ed Balls&lt;/strong> told a select committee that the government would no longer be promoting faith schools  - as &lt;strong>Tony Blair&lt;/strong> did, though Balls refrained from saying so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPs did see that as ''a marked change'' and some blame the Catholic hierarchy, which has been increasingly uncooperative towards joint faith ventures in education. Why ? One theory is jostling to become the next cardinal at the head of the English church by bishops who want Cardinal Cormack Murphy O'Connor's job when he is called to even higher service. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>LUNCHTIME &lt;/strong>Westminster&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By chance I bumped into &lt;strong>Andy Coulson,&lt;/strong> the former News of the World editor, who is now &lt;strong>David Cameron's&lt;/strong> communications chief and very chirpy about the boss's good showing in this week's YouGov poll. Neither of us is quite sure what &lt;strong>Stephen Carter&lt;/strong>, Gordon Brown's new chief of staff, is supposed to be: the organisation man and gatekeeper or an &lt;strong>Alastair Campbell&lt;/strong> figure. The former, I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I ALSO HAD&lt;/strong> a coffee in Portcullis House with up-and-coming shadow cabinet member and fellow billiard ball &lt;strong>Chris Grayling&lt;/strong> (actually, we never got round to the coffee) over the Tory welfare reform package, which he and Dave have been promoting this week. That is the one that seeks to limit the right to job seeker's allowance (JSA) to two years in total to stop claimants - especially young and able-bodied ones - from playing the system by dropping out of JSA just short of six months - when officialdom looms - then start claiming again after a brief interval. The young can't be left to rot on benefit, he says. &lt;strong>Blair&lt;/strong> and Brown said the same, and many others before them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris Grayling also wants (so does Brown, so did &lt;strong>John Major&lt;/strong>) to cut the 2.6 million total of invalidity benefit (IB) claimants. Ministers have attacked its cost and impracticality, but Grayling - who made his backbench reputation as an attack dog of the kind Alastair Campbell would have admired - says it can be done if Treasury rules are changed to allow savings to be ploughed back into the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MP is also sanguine about getting doctors to vet all IB claimants over a couple of years. GPs can't do it because they know their patients and it might be awkward: we've all heard stories of doctors who bump into their IB claimants on the squash court. Outsiders have to be hired. But hey, we have been training a lot more doctors and there aren't the jobs for all of them in the NHS, he explains. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I happen to have had lunch yesterday with a couple of Americans who had been facing British hostility in London for years - not personally, but anti-Bush stuff. One hit back by genially quoting an actress interviewed about going to live in the US. California is wonderful, she said, ''but after a while you do miss British negativity". So I was on my best behaviour towards Grayling, who is being accused in some quarters of wanting to restore the Victorian workhouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He had the sort of optimism that often characterises opposition spokesmen when they finally sense they may be on a winning streak at last. The mood may survive into office, before being worn down by events and experience - which could be what is happening to Labour after 10 years in power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SOME OF&lt;/strong> the Tory ideas are said to come from the mid-to-north-western US state of Wisconsin, a hotbed of welfare reform even in my time in the US in the 80s. Grayling has not been there, but is surprised to learn that it has a progressive reputation at least as much as a conservative one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For much of the 20th century, as the state's governors and senators, the&lt;strong> LaFollette &lt;/strong>family embodied the ''progressive movement'', which promoted workmen's compensation, income tax and other benefits for the poor.  Admittedly this relatively isolated state, half its population of German stock, also nurtured the dreaded rightwing demagogue &lt;strong>Senator Joe McCarthy&lt;/strong>, embodiment of the anti-communist witch hunts of the 50s. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it also had a strong socialist, even Trotskyite, tradition around Milwaukee. The state swung against Reagan and Bush II, and is currently Democrat-dominated. Citizens were active against the Iraq war as they were 20 years ago against the US-backed contra campaign in Nicaragua. It backed &lt;strong>Al Gore&lt;/strong> and even &lt;strong>John Kerry&lt;/strong>. We may hear little of it over here because it doesn't quite fit those negative British stereotypes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>AT THE&lt;/strong> Home Office new year drinks there is much interest among the hacks in junior minister &lt;strong>Vernon Coaker's&lt;/strong> forthcoming trip to Sweden and Holland to see how EU progressives are doing in trying to curb what &lt;strong>Harriet Harman&lt;/strong> sometimes calls ''the demand for sex'' - ie penalising those who buy prostitutes' services as well as those who solicit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The straight-forward Coker says the growth in trafficked foreign women has raised alarm in both countries, as it has here, making it harder to advance the argument that some women choose to go into the oldest profession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Women working in brothels are at risk of exploitation and violence in ways that those working the streets used to be regarded, the minister tells us. What is the explanation for the growth of foreign sex workers? Is it a bit like fruit-picking: that locals won't do it any more? Or is it a question of cheap labour, I ask?  The minister seems to think there has been a growth in demand and says he and his colleagues - Vera Baird and Barbara Follett are going on the trip too - are determined to find ways to curb it. Hmm. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ELSEWHERE &lt;/strong> in my travels I meet a bright young man who mumbles something about having attended one of our great public schools and observes that lots of young Tories much prefer the US Democrats to the Republicans. ''It's so much cooler,'' he explains. When I open my Guardian this morning I find that David Cameron has been praising &lt;strong>Senator Barack Obama&lt;/strong>. What will Andy Coulson say? The Cameroons have only lately become persona grata at the White House again after &lt;strong>Michael Howard&lt;/strong> was deemed to have dissed &lt;strong>George W&lt;/strong> when being tricksy over the Iraq war vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>THE BBC's Nick Robinson&lt;/strong> was just finishing his 6pm broadcast from outside No 10 when he bumped into &lt;strong>David Beckham&lt;/strong> emerging from a visit to see GB, who has apparently promised to visit his football academy. No 10 says it was a genuinely private visit and Brown ducked mentioning it at his monthly presser beforehand. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Politicians can't win on this sort of thing. Beckham said nice things about Brown (''He's a very good man'') because Beckham is that sort of man himself.  We know Brown has a lifelong interest in football, stronger than Blair's by a mile. But he will be accused of milking whatever publicity ensues, whether he wanted it or not, let alone willed it by inviting Los Angeles's finest through the front door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: &lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nick Clegg's&lt;/strong> debut as Lib Dem leader in the Commons was the significant point of an otherwise routine new year session on PM's questions in which both Gordon Brown and David Cameron cheerfully pulled limbs off each other over ID cards and capital gains tax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did Clegg do? Well enough, I thought. He has repositioned himself three places away from the traditional leader's corner seat - further from me, Cameron noted -  and got  &lt;strong>Chris Huhne, &lt;/strong>his defeated rival, and stand-in star, &lt;strong>Vince Cable,&lt;/strong> to sit next to him in a collegiate gesture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By challenging Brown on winter fuel poverty - 4 million families at risk as prices soar, he said - he ensured that Labour MPs would not barrack him. He was also signalling that he wants to concentrate on bread and butter issues involving fairness and inequality rather than more high-minded Lib Dem themes like opposition to ID cards. Cameron had already trousered that one, as Clegg aides suspected he might, just to snooker their own man.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good choice, I thought. GB defended his record, which is good on fuel poverty but - like the big bad wolf in the fairy story - told the lad his door is always open to discuss issues of common ground. Young Nick Riding Hood will be well advised to stay away from that door until and unless Brown's position weakens.&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/blog/2008/jan/09/michaelwhitespoliticalblog59|2010-04-17T19:41:22+01:00|d885dc519506be2efb053ce3384a54e63bf42bbf --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/xp2pe</field></fields><tags><tag type="blog" web-title="Politics blog" id="politics/blog" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Welfare" id="politics/welfare" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/welfare" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Liberal Democrats" id="politics/liberaldemocrats" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberaldemocrats" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Michael White" id="profile/michaelwhite" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelwhite" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michaelwhite" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="PMQs" id="politics/pmqs" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/pmqs" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/pmqs" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Politics TV" id="tv-and-radio/politics-tv" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/politics-tv" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/politics-tv" section-id="tv-and-radio" section-name="Television &amp;amp; radio" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
