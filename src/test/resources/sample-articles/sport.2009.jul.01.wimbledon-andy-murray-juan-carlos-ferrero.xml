Indeed he is already looking beyond his quarter-final opponent and has admitted that only victory in the final on Sunday will satisfy his ambition this year.&lt;/p>&lt;p>"It's not like you're going to be satisfied with a quarter-final," he said. "I've got the chance to go further than I did last year, and to win the tournament. That's my goal and that's the change in my mentality this time."&lt;/p>&lt;p>In last year's fourth round, Murray defeated France's Richard Gasquet, also in five sets, and in exactly the same time – 3hr 57min. He was then savagely beaten by Rafael Nadal, who went on to end Roger Federer's run of five successive titles. "I just felt emotionally flat then. Now I feel fine. I think I know how to recover better than I did before. I've got the right guys around me, and they know how my body works, so we'll do the right things to get me ready." These are Miles Maclagan, his coach, Andy Ireland his physio, and ­fitness coaches Matty Little and Jez Green. Aka, Team Murray.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Even last year Murray felt he could have won the title. "But really it's not until you get past the quarter-final stage, or get to the final of a slam like I did at the US Open, that you understand what that feels like. You come up against someone like Nadal who has done it over and over again, and their mentality is going to be better than yours because it's normal for them to get into the latter stages of tournaments. And it wasn't until after last year's Wimbledon that I was able to do that on a consistent basis."&lt;/p>&lt;p>Murray has now reached the quarter-finals or better in four of the last five slams, missing out at the Australian Open earlier this year when he was beaten by Spain's Fernando Verdasco in the fourth round. The match against Wawrinka, the first to be played entirely under the new multi-million pound roof, was much tougher than he had expected, though Murray reported "no problems". "I feel fine, though usually you feel stiffer later in the day. I slept fine from around 1am till about 10am. The dog slept with us, but Kim got up early and took her out for a walk."&lt;/p>&lt;p>Thereafter all was routine, though there seems little doubt that the All England club's decision to play Murray's fourth-round match indoors appeared to throw him. He had expected the roof to be open, and was clearly fretting in the opening set when he dropped his serve twice, although the experience could work to his advantage if he has to play once more in such circumstances. "Now I will know what to expect if the roof comes on again."&lt;/p>&lt;p>Murray, revelling in the extraordinary thrill of having a genuine chance to become the first British player to win the men's Wimbledon title since Fred Perry in 1936, has not substantially changed his preparations since last year. "I'm going to have the same amount of recovery time, but my body just feels so much stronger, and I recover better from long matches."&lt;/p>&lt;p>He loved the atmosphere under the roof, though admitted it had taken him some time to adjust. "It just changes the way the court plays. It's a lot heavier than during the day, though that's the only real difference."&lt;/p>&lt;p>Federer will open Wednesday on the Centre Court against the huge-serving Ivo ­Karlovic, having recently remarked: "It's not real tennis against Ivo, it's all about reaction," though he has only lost once against the Croatian in nine meetings. Then comes Murray's quarter-final against Ferrero.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Tonight Murray had his feet up, watching a little television after the usual practising, stretching, ice bath and massage. "Nothing interesting ­unfortunately," he smiled. "Maybe there will be a few more aches and pains, but I have the right people with me to try and make sure I'm 100%".&lt;/p>&lt;p>Murray has played Ferrero, the former French Open champion and world No1, and a wild card here, only once before, beating him 6–2, 6–4 in the semi-finals of the Aegon Championships at Queen's prior to winning the title this year, the first British winner since Bunny Austin in 1938. It would be a huge shock if the Spaniard won this time, though Murray will want to make a much better start than against Wawrinka, roof or no roof.&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2009/jul/01/wimbledon-andy-murray-juan-carlos-ferrero|2010-04-18T13:22:46+01:00|4d9d061f0e39fad68a6b3ea8eb47f4741deb0e8d --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/29v2v</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="Wimbledon" id="sport/wimbledon" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/wimbledon" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/wimbledon" section-id="sport" section-name="Sport" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Andy Murray" id="sport/andymurray" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/andymurray" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/andymurray" section-id="sport" section-name="Sport" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Roger Federer" id="sport/federer" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/federer" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/federer" section-id="sport" section-name="Sport" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Rafael Nadal" id="sport/rafaelnadal" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/rafaelnadal" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/rafaelnadal" section-id="sport" section-name="Sport" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Tennis" id="sport/tennis" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/tennis" section-id="sport" section-name="Sport" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Steve Bierley" id="profile/stevebierley" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/stevebierley" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevebierley" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
