 The one true winner in New Hampshire. Her unexpected win followed a painful five days after Iowa when Barack Obama appeared to have the dreams of many Democrats in his hands - and conventional wisdom wrote off the Clintons as a political force. As she said in her winning speech, she may also have found a "voice" in New Hampshire she can take to the primary states ahead.&lt;P>&lt;b>Barack Obama&lt;/b>&lt;br>
 A week as an apparently unassailable frontrunner greatly enhanced Obama's candidacy and he takes away a lot from the state. The pricking of Obama-mania would have perhaps come anyway, but the abruptness with which it came in New Hampshire will give his campaign its biggest test. But he is still in the race, and with his concession speech gave another display of his inspiring rhetoric.&lt;P>&lt;b>John Edwards&lt;/b>&lt;br>
He came second in Iowa when he needed to come first, and third in New Hampshire when he needed to come second. It is hard to see how he can continue a campaign with hopes of securing the nomination, when his hopes of even entering a two-person race would appear to rest on one of either Clinton or Obama's bids imploding.&lt;P>&lt;b>John McCain&lt;/b>&lt;br>
He won the New Hampshire primary last time he stood for president but it failed to propel him to the nomination. If the 71-year-old McCain can this time project his appeal to independent-minded New Hampshire voters beyond the state he could become a winner.&lt;P>&lt;b>Mitt Romney&lt;/b>&lt;br>
Two second places, the latter in a New England state where the former Massachusetts governor pitched himself as almost a local product, have not given Romney the aura of success he was aiming for. His personal fortune allows him to stay in the race for as long as he wants, but if he next week loses Michigan (where he was born) his ability to win elections must be in doubt.&lt;P>&lt;b>Mike Huckabee&lt;/b>&lt;br>
The Iowa winner remarked in his concession speech that he had leapt from six place a few weeks ago to third when the votes came. Even so, there is no disguising that his Iowa triumph failed to give him a significant bounce in New Hampshire. If Huckabee cannot demonstrate significant electoral appeal beyond a core evangelical vote his candidacy is doomed.&lt;P>&lt;b>Rudy Giuliani&lt;/b>&lt;br>
His 9% was just 1% above Ron Paul, a candidate who espouses such causes as the abolition of the US Federal Reserve. Giuliani claims he is concentrating on Florida but his name recognition, a television ad spend of $2.5m and 100 visits over the campaign ought to have at least pushed him into double figures.&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2008/jan/09/uselections2008|2010-04-17T19:43:11+01:00|557ebdee52f8ad14a5e83f7f4e928f29ee7f2666 --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/x226g</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="US elections 2008" id="world/us-elections-2008" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-elections-2008" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-elections-2008" section-id="world" section-name="World news" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="New Hampshire" id="world/new-hampshire" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/world/new-hampshire" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/new-hampshire" section-id="world" section-name="World news" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
