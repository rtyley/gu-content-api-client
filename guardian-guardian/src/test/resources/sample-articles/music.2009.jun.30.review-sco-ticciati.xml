As Ticciati took another trip to the Highlands last weekend, it was as the SCO's new principal conductor designate, a&amp;nbsp;post he takes up in the autumn. Ticciati's second programme with the orchestra was a near-carbon copy of his first, combining French repertoire with one of Haydn's London symphonies.&lt;/p>&lt;p>In Fauré's Pelléas et Mélisande suite, Ticciati focused on the atmospheric magic of the score, working with gossamer-fine precision. Poulenc's Flute Sonata with SCO principal flautist Alison Mitchell was a further study in sonority.&lt;/p>&lt;p>With Haydn's Clock Symphony, Ticciati moved from colour to structure and substance. I wasn't hugely taken with his Haydn last year, and his performance of the Clock elicited much the same response. His approach is vigorous and well-crafted, but where is the irrepressible spirit of Haydn's music?&lt;/p>&lt;p>The first movement – the tempo falling rather short of presto – was weighted and rather deliberate. While the rest of the symphony felt less laboured, there was little that was playful about this performance. There was plenty to admire in the attention to detail and the shaping and phrasing, but it came with the sensation that Ticciati's Haydn was more grandly symphonic than something that fitted comfortably within the dimensions of a&amp;nbsp;chamber&amp;nbsp;orchestra.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Some of these issues undoubtedly touch on the thorny matter of personal taste. Time will tell if Ticciati's partnership with the SCO is a perfect match. Meanwhile, I'm reserving judgment until I hear him and the orchestra perform something on a different scale – such as Brahms and Mahler in December.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;strong> &lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2009/jun/30/review-sco-ticciati|2010-04-18T13:22:19+01:00|744d7870ca1a9add9eca5f5db85652e13f20d119 --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/29vv2</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="Classical music" id="music/classicalmusicandopera" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/classicalmusicandopera" section-id="music" section-name="Music" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Rowena Smith" id="profile/rowenasmith" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowenasmith" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rowenasmith" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
