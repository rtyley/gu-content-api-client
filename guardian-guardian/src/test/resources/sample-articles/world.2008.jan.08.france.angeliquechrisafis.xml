"It's serious," replied Sarkozy. "It isn't the JDD which will fix the date." He added: "There are strong chances that you'll learn about it when it's already happened."&lt;P>Sarkozy's admission came as the president slumped to his lowest poll ratings since his election last year.&lt;P>Only 48% of French voters now trust him, partly because of the country's flagging economy, which he continually promised to address.&lt;P>The public is also irritated by a "bling-bling" president they see as deliberately playing out his love life like a Hollywood star.&lt;P>Sarkozy reluctantly divorced his second wife, CÃ©cilia, in October last year and met Bruni just weeks later at a dinner party.&lt;P>The Italian tyre heiress has previously dated Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton and a former French socialist prime minister. Before appearing in public with Bruni, Sarkozy reportedly commissioned private polls and decided the French would be impressed with his glamorous catch.&lt;P>Their first public date was to watch the Mickey Mouse parade at Disneyland Paris.&lt;P>Then they jetted to Egypt for Christmas, borrowing the private jet of one of France's richest tycoons. On the banks of the Nile, the couple posed for the cameras.&lt;P>Last weekend, Sarkozy led Bruni around one of the main temples in Petra, Jordan, which featured in the Hollywood film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2008/jan/08/france|2010-04-17T19:44:31+01:00|5f08280cbd5b9a2e8a9088f35af1de17ea34e9b8 --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/xxje9</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="France" id="world/france" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/world/france" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france" section-id="world" section-name="World news" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="James Orr" id="profile/jamesorr" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/jamesorr" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesorr" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Nicolas Sarkozy" id="world/nicolas-sarkozy" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolas-sarkozy" section-id="world" section-name="World news" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Carla Bruni-Sarkozy" id="culture/carla-bruni-sarkozy" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/carla-bruni-sarkozy" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/carla-bruni-sarkozy" section-id="culture" section-name="Culture" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
