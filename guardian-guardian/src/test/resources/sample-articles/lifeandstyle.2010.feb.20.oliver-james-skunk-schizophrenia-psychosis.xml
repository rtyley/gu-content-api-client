How real is the risk to your offspring?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Overall, more sons smoke marijuana (henceforth, "dope"). The definitive 2007 national survey of the mental health of 7,300 English adults shows 41% of 16- to 24-year-old men have tried it (37% of women), rising to 57% of  25- to 34-year-old men (34% of women).&lt;/p>&lt;p>Many studies show that people who develop psychosis or schizo­phrenia (hallucinations, identity confusion, ­delusions) are generally more likely than the non-psychotic to have smoked dope, and to have been heavy&amp;nbsp;users. When studied over time, a dose-dependent relationship is found.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Six studies carried out in five ­different countries show that the more a person smokes, the greater the risk. For example, 50,000 Swedes were asked at age 18 if they had ever tried the drug and were followed up at age 33. Compared with non-users, those who had done it up to 50 times by age 18 were three times more likely to ­develop schizophrenia at 33, and those who had done it on more than 50 ­occasions were six times more likely.&lt;/p>&lt;p>These odds dropped when other risk factors were taken into account, such as whether the 18-year-old already had a mental illness or divorced parents, or whether there were relatives in the ­family with the illness. Other studies also suggest strongly that it is not dope alone that causes psychosis; it only does so in people with a pre-existing vulnerability. Nonetheless, it has been estimated that if no one at all smoked dope, 13% fewer people would develop schizophrenia.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A key recent study looked at the specific effect of skunk, which has four to six times more of the psychosis-­inducing chemical ingredient (THC) than ordinary cannabis resin. Resin was the commonest dope until the early 2000s; now skunk has a 70% market share. The study showed that skunk ­users who smoked it less than once a day were still five times more likely to have had a first psychotic episode. Even worse, this was 12 times more likely if they used it daily: the heavier the ­skunk-smoking, the greater the risk.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Overall, there seems little serious doubt that dope in general and skunk in particular greatly increase the risk of psychosis or schizophrenia. What is desperately lacking is a study exploring how the key factors that create vulnerability to psychotic illness interact with skunk.&lt;/p>&lt;p>While there is some (unreplicated) evidence that genes can increase the risk of dope triggering psychosis, as I&amp;nbsp;have pointed out before (23 Jan­uary), it looks increasingly unlikely that genes will explain much mental illness. ­ By contrast, there is growing evidence that upbringing creates vulnerability. For example, it is now widely accepted (based on 13 studies) that at least half of schizophrenics were abused, mostly sexually. It is also highly likely that early childhood deprivation and subsequently confusing care increase the risk.&lt;/p>&lt;p>So if your child does become ­psychotic after smoking skunk, beware of doctors who pretend to have a scientific basis for their insistence that it was due to a pre-existing genetic vulnerability and who offer pills as the only solution. I am sorry to have to tell you it is far more likely that the vulnerability was caused by the child's nurture and that a psychoanalytic psychotherapist is required (see &lt;a href="http://www.psychoanalytic-council.org/main/" title="psychoanalytic-council.org/main/">psychoanalytic-council.org&lt;/a>). While medication may be advisable initially, to calm someone down, that is never a long-term cure.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>Review of studies: Degenhardt, L et&amp;nbsp;al, 2006, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 51, 556-65; Recent skunk study: Di Forti, M et al, 2009, British Journal of Psychiatry, 195, 488-91.
