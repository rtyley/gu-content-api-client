A three-course dinner, featuring sole fillet with crab, will cost £16.90.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A SNP spokeswoman said both Salmond and Sturgeon were today writing to the parliamentary authorities to seek "clarification and guidance" about the rules, and would cancel both events if they were advised to.&lt;/p>&lt;p>She said other MSPs had regularly auctioned lunches in the past. But Labour insisted they were for charities and not party fundraising. The rules "just seems confused", she added. "Nobody seems to know what's in and what's out."&lt;/p>&lt;p>Gray added: "These are very serious allegations accusing Alex Salmond of selling the office of first minister for SNP funds. The implication of 'cash for access' to the first minister and his deputy has to be answered."&lt;/p>&lt;p>He said the Tory leader, David Cameron, had been "rebuked and forced to apologise" after he offered Conservative party donors the chance of lunch with him at the House of Commons in 2007, in return for a £50,000 subscription to a "leader's club".&lt;/p>&lt;p>A spokesman for the Scottish parliament indicated that the authorities were unhappy. "The policy on the use of parliamentary resources states that parliamentary resources are provided by the SPCB [Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body] to support members with their parliamentary duties," he said.&lt;/p>&lt;p>"These resources, which include the members' restaurant, must not be used for any other purpose, including any significant party political purposes."&lt;/p>&lt;p>The row is the latest in a series of controversies over Salmond's use of his expenses as MP for Banff and Buchan, and his office as first minister.&lt;/p>&lt;p>During the MPs' expenses scandal it emerged he had claimed a £400 a month Commons meals allowance during the recess, while he was working in Scotland, and during the Scottish parliament elections campaign.&lt;/p>&lt;p>However, Salmond was cleared of any wrongdoing today by both Sir Thomas Legg, the Commons auditor, and John Lyon, the parliamentary standards commissioner. Legg said he now had "no issues" with a £710.88 claim he had originally challenged. Lyon has already ruled that meals allowances are not under scrutiny.&lt;/p>&lt;p>In November, it emerged he treated his private dentist, Murray Bremner, and Bremner's wife, Jane, to a VIP dinner and concert by the Gaelic rock band Runrig at Scone Palace, and to tickets to the Edinburgh military tattoo followed by dinner at his official residence, using the first minister's hospitality budget.&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2010/feb/04/alex-salmond-holyrood-lunch-auction|2010-03-31T18:23:00+01:00|bca41d68977bf36883c71a0447f9ef03b7f3d4d9 --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/2emhf</field><field name="internal-page-code">1354956</field><field name="standfirst">Investigation launched after it emerges that the Scottish first minister and his deputy auctioned private lunches in Holyrood's members' restaurant at an SNP fundraising event</field><field name="thumbnail">http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/23/Salmond140x84.jpg</field><field name="byline">Severin Carrell, Scotland correspondent</field><field name="publication">guardian.co.uk</field><field name="internal-content-code">358962675</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="Scottish politics" id="politics/scotland" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/scotland" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scotland" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Severin Carrell" id="profile/severincarrell" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/severincarrell" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/severincarrell" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Scotland" id="uk/scotland" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland" section-id="uk" section-name="UK news" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Alex Salmond" id="politics/alexsalmond" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/alexsalmond" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alexsalmond" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="keyword" web-title="Scottish National Party (SNP)" id="politics/snp" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/snp" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/snp" section-id="politics" section-name="Politics" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
