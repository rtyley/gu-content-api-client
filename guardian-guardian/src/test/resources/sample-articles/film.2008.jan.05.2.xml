Unless you're one of those brand name "actorly" stars in the De Niro/Streep firmament, and your career is explicitly predicated upon how different your next role is from your last, then the movie star watchwords are safe, comfy, repetitive, reliable and familiar.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cases in point: Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson's War. Hanks - who is to actors what cheery, optimistic, all-American Frank Capra was to directors - can only truly be Tom Hanks. He's not about to play any psychopaths or rapists: he'll never venture any further down the road leading to evil than he does as good-time Charlie Wilson, the priapic Texas congressman who tooled up the Afghan mujahideen to fight the darn Russkies a quarter-century ago, little suspecting those weapons would one day be pointed at decent, God-fearing Americans. Charlie's a horny old toad, he likes to bend congressional rules and short-circuit procedure, but evil? Aw, hell no!&lt;/p>&lt;p>And Julia? As with Hanks, everything she does is exquisitely timed and deftly handled, but entirely circumscribed by our knowledge of the limits that stardom imposes. You see the name on the marquee and you know exactly what to expect.&lt;/p>&lt;p>And they cost so much! If director Mike Nichols had stripped Hanks and Roberts of their gargantuan salaries, he could have restaged the Russo-Afghan war on a truly epic scale. And he could have made Philip Seymour Hoffman's role the lead. His character, a rumpled and resentful CIA rogue, is far more interesting than good time Charlie. Oscar or not, Hoffman comes a hell of a lot cheaper than his co-stars, and he works twice as hard at making them look good. And not having been sealed off behind the carapace of super-celebrity years ago, he can still walk down the street unrecognised and absorb (and retransmit to the audience) the rhythms and tone of real life, instead of being trapped in gated communities with billionaires, bodyguards and bulletproof glass for company.&lt;/p>&lt;p>So it's time, I think, for a mutiny of the character players, the kind of Hollywood coup d'etat that could really do this town some good. Imagine Hoffman - or any of the myriad great character actors in Los Angeles and New York, like Tony Shalhoub, Catherine Keener, Tim Blake Nelson, Stephen Root, Richard Jenkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Edie Falco, Lili Taylor, to name a minuscule sample - imagine them stopping production in midstream, making Tom and Julia walk the plank before seizing the ship and letting the character actors shape the movie to their liking, and likely enough, to ours as well.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Down with John Wayne. Up with Ward Bond!&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: film/2008/jan/05/2|2010-04-18T14:11:38+01:00|9b0f31d137308f6a3fe748e5b3dfab69dbf058ee --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/xk3nv</field></fields><tags><tag type="contributor" web-title="John Patterson" id="profile/johnpatterson" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/johnpatterson" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnpatterson" /><tag type="tone" web-title="Comment" id="tone/comment" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone/comment" /><tag type="series" web-title="If only" id="film/series/ifonly" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/ifonly" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/series/ifonly" section-id="film" section-name="Film" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
