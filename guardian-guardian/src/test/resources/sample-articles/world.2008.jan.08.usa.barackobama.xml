Starbucks had its nose put out of joint last year when Consumer Reports, a US magazine, gave McDonald's coffee a higher taste rating.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The changes will start in McDonald's 14,000 US branches, though improvements in Britain are also promised.&lt;/p>&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2008/jan/08/usa|2010-04-17T19:45:43+01:00|04a9f5775ad2f860a222a90d2f7db225c0c2f02d --></field><field name="short-url">http://gu.com/p/xx2zh</field></fields><tags><tag type="keyword" web-title="United States" id="world/usa" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa" section-id="world" section-name="World news" /><tag type="contributor" web-title="Andrew Clark" id="profile/andrewclark" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/andrewclark" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewclark" /><tag type="type" web-title="Article" id="type/article" api-url="http://content.guardianapis.com/articles" web-url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles" /></tags></content></response>
