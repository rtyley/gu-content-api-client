Congratulations to the winners, who were Sharon Vanstone of Cardiff, Emma Holder of Hereford, Sheila Rich of Brighton, Nigel Kippen of Great Yarmouth and Sandra Woods of Norwich.&lt;/strong> &lt;/p>&lt;p>If you're planning a garden revamp, trying to find a new look for your borders or even just daydreaming about your ideal garden Stafford Cliff's &lt;a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781844007080">1000 Garden Ideas&lt;/a> can help. The idea is simple: minimal text, but page after page of photos grouped into different categories: paths and paving, vistas, colour and statues, and chairs, seats and benches, for instance. You're bound to find just the right kind of paving or pool to suit your garden, and be inspired by the sheer range of styles on display. &lt;/p>&lt;p>1000 Garden Ideas is published in paperback by Quadrille next week. We've got five copies of the book to give away.
